## Description

This project is a program that allows people to create meetings at a central location based on participants’ locations. The website will allow users to enter information about their location, create meetings and invite people into those meetings. The creator can select a type of venue that they’d like the meeting to take place at, and the participants will be notified by email. After putting in their locations, the website will use a map API to find the most central location based on the locations of the participants, and look for the nearest place that fits the selected type.
